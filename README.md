I got bored one stormy afternoon and decided to code pong in auto hotkey. It isnt great and has its flaws but I think its pretty cool. 
It slowly gets faster and it works so yeahhh.
The icon was made in mspaint, and its really bad which was kinda what I was going for. 

The game takes up no space, so why not download it?
